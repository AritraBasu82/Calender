# 📅 Simple 2026 Calendar Project

This is a simple web-based calendar I created to show the months and days of the year **2026**. I built this to practice using JavaScript to handle dates and dynamically update a web page.

## 🌟 What it Does

* **Shows 2026:** It starts specifically on January 2026.
* **Navigation:** You can click the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to move through the months.
* **Smart Dates:** It automatically knows how many days are in each month and what day of the week the month starts on.
* **Modern Design:** I used a "Dark Mode" look with a grid layout for the days.

## 🛠️ How it was Built

* **HTML5:** Created the structure for the calendar header and the grid for the days.
* **CSS3:** Used a dark background and flexbox to make sure the days line up perfectly in rows of seven.
* **JavaScript:** This is the "brain" of the project. It uses the `Date()` object to calculate the calendar layout for any month.

## 📝 Things I Learned
